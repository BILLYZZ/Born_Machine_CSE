# Run These:

1. The MBL_Example_Random_Search.ipynb file contains an example/tutorial of calling the library to create a Many Body Localization Heisenberg XXZ model.

2. The MBL_Example_XXZ_Debug.ipynb file contains a side by side example of modeling Many Body Localization Heisenberg XXZ models using two methods: the exact diagonalization and the symmetrized trotterization methods.

3. The Adversarial_Deep_Kernel_Example_MCR.ipynb contains the procedure to train a naive Multi-layer parameterized (MLP) Born machine to learn a Gaussian distribution with a deep neural netowrk kernel (discriminator/critic) with the novel MCR objective
